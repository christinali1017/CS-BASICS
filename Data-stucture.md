###Hashing
---
In general, in all searching techniques, search time is dependent on the number of items. Sequential search, binary search and all the search trees are totally dependent on number of items and many key comparisons are involved.

**Hashing is a technique where search time is independent of the number of items or elements. In this technique a hash function is used to generate an address from a key. The hash function takes a key as input and returns the hash value of that key which is used as an address index in the array.**

**Techniques for making hash function.**

- **Truncation Method**: In this method we take only a part of the key as address.
- **Midsquare Method**: In this method the key is squared and some digits from the middle of this square are taken as address.
- **Folding Method**: In this technique the key is divided into different part where the length of each part is same as that of the required address, except possibly the last part.
- **Division Method(Modulo-Division)**: In Modulo-Division method the key is mod by the table size and the remainder is taken as the address of the hash table.


**Collision resolution**:

- Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)
  * Linear Probing 
  * Quadratic Probing
  * Double Hashing
- Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)

**Linear probing**:

In this method if address given by hash function is already occupied, then **the key will be inserted in the next empty position in hash table**. 
For a given hash value, the indices generated by linear probing are as follows:

**H + 1 , H + 2 , H + 3 , H + 4 , ... , H + k**

 **The performance of linear probing is also more sensitive to input distribution when compared to double hashing**, where the step size is determined by another hash function applied to the value instead of a fixed step size as in linear probing.

**Quadratic probing**:
An example sequence using quadratic probing is:

**H + 1^2 , H + 2^2 , H + 3^2 , H + 4^2 , ... , H + k^2**

**Quadratic probing** can be a more efficient algorithm in a closed hash table, since it **better avoids the clustering problem** that can occur with linear probing, although it is not immune. It also provides good memory caching because it preserves some locality of reference; however, **linear probing has greater locality and, thus, better cache performance.**

**Double hashing:**

Given two randomly, uniformly, and independently selected hash functions h_1 and h_2, the ith location in the bucket sequence for value k in a hash table T is: **h(i,k)=(h_1(k) + i * h_2(k)) mod |T|** Generally, h_1 and h_2 are selected from a set of universal hash functions.

###AVL tree or height balanced binary search tree.
---

An AVL tree is **binary search tree (BST)** where the **difference in the height** of left and right subtrees of any node can be **at most one**.

**Rotation**:
After insertion or deletion operation the balance factor of the nodes in AVL tree can be changed and the tree may not be balanced. We can balance this tree by performing tree rotations.

- Right Rotation 
- Left Rotation


###DFS vs BFS
---

That heavily depends on the structure of the search tree and the number and location of solutions (aka searched-for items). 

If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree, a breadth first search (BFS) might be better. **If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, depth first search (DFS) might take an extremely long time, but BFS could be faster**. If the tree is very wide, a BFS might need too much memory, so it might be completely impractical. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree, BFS could be impractical. If the search tree is very deep you will need to restrict the search depth for depth first search (DFS), anyway (for example with iterative deepening).
