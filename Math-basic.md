###Arithmetic progression(等差数列)

- A sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.

- Example: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 … 

- Induction: **An = A1 + (n - 1) * d** Or **An = Am + (n - m) * d**

- **Sum**

    * To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:

    * Sn=a1+(a1+d)+(a1+2d)+....+(a1+(n-2)d)+(a1+(n-1)d)
    * Sn=(an-(n-1)d)+(an-(n-2)d)+...+(an - 2d)+(an-d)+an.
    * Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving d cancel:**2Sn=n(a1 + an)**, which is **Sn = n * (A1 + An) / 2
