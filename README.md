##Operation System

####IPC

Inter process communication.
- Shared memory
- Message passing

Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking. Blocking is considerd synchronous. Non-blocking is considered asynchronous.


####Latency and Throughput

Latency is the time required to perform some action or to produce some result.

Throughput is the number of such actions executed or results produced per unit of time. 

Example: Suppose there is a factory which takes 8 hours to produce a car and it can produce 100 cars per day.

Then the latency is 8 hours. Throughput is 100 cars/day.
